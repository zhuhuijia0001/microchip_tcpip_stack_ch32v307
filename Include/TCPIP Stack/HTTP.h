 *
 * Output:          Opened HTTP connections are served.
 *
 * Side Effects:    None
 *
 * Overview:        Browse through each connections and let it
 *                  handle its connection.
 *                  If a connection is not finished, do not process
 *                  next connections.  This must be done, all

 * Note:            This function acts as a task (similar to one in

 *                  this function repeatdly to ensure all open
 *                  or new connections are served on time.
