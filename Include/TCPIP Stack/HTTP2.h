  Function:
	HTTP_READ_STATUS HTTPReadPostPair(BYTE* cData, WORD wLen)

  Summary:
	Reads a name and value pair from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.

  Description:
	Reads a name and value pair from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.
	This function is meant to be called from an HTTPExecutePost callback to 
	facilitate easier parsing of incoming data.  This function also prevents 
	buffer overflows by forcing the programmer to indicate how many bytes are 
	expected.  At least 2 extra bytes are needed in cData over the maximum 
	length of data expected to be read.
	
	This function will read until the next '&' character, which indicates the
	end of a value parameter.  It assumes that the front of the buffer is
	the beginning of the name paramter to be read.
	
	This function properly updates curHTTP.byteCount by decrementing it
	by the number of bytes read.  It also removes the delimiting '&' from
	the buffer.
	
	Once complete, two strings will exist in the cData buffer.  The first is 
	the parameter name that was read, while the second is the associated 
	value.

  Precondition:
	Front of TCP buffer is the beginning of a name parameter, and the rest of
	the TCP buffer contains a URL-encoded string with a name parameter 
	terminated by a '=' character and a value parameter terminated by a '&'.

  Parameters:
	cData - where to store the name and value strings once they are read
	wLen - how many bytes can be written to cData

  Return Values:
	HTTP_READ_OK - name and value were successfully read
	HTTP_READ_TRUNCTATED - entire name and value could not fit in the buffer, 
							so input was truncated and data has been lost
	HTTP_READ_INCOMPLETE - entire name and value was not yet in the buffer, 
							so call this function again later to retrieve

  Remarks:
	This function is aliased to HTTPReadPostValue, since they effectively
	perform the same task.  The name is provided only for completeness.

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
	HTTP_IO_RESULT HTTPExecuteGet(void)

  Summary:
	Processes GET form field variables and cookies.

  Description:
	This function is implemented by the application developer in 
	CustomHTTPApp.c.  Its purpose is to parse the data received from
	URL parameters (GET method forms) and cookies and perform any 
	application-specific tasks in response to these inputs.  Any 
	required authentication has already been validated.
	
	When this function is called, curHTTP.data contains sequential
	name/value pairs of strings representing the data received.  In this
	format, HTTPGetArg and HTTPGetROMArg can be used to search for 
	specific variables in the input.  If data buffer space associated 
	with this connection is required, curHTTP.data may be overwritten
	here once the application is done with the values.  Any data placed
	there will be available to future callbacks for this connection, 
	including HTTPExecutePost and any HTTPPrint_varname dynamic
	substitutions.
	
	This function may also issue redirections by setting curHTTP.data
	to the destination file name or URL, and curHTTP.httpStatus to
	HTTP_REDIRECT.
	
	Finally, this function may set cookies.  Set curHTTP.data to a series
	of name/value string pairs (in the same format in which parameters
	arrive) and then set curHTTP.hasArgs equal to the number of cookie
	name/value pairs.  The cookies will be transmitted to the browser, 
	and any future requests will have those values available in
	curHTTP.data.

  Precondition:
	None

  Parameters:
	None

  Return Values:
	HTTP_IO_DONE - application is done processing
	HTTP_IO_NEED_DATA - this value may not be returned because more data
						will not become available
	HTTP_IO_WAITING - the application is waiting for an asynchronous
					  process to complete, and this function should be
					  called again later

  Remarks:
	This function is only called if variables are received via URL
	parameters or Cookie arguments.  This function may NOT write to the
	TCP buffer.
	
	This function may service multiple HTTP requests simultaneously.  
	Exercise caution when using global or static variables inside this 
	routine.  Use curHTTP.callbackPos or curHTTP.data for storage associated 
	with individual requests.
  ***************************************************************************/
HTTP_IO_RESULT HTTPExecuteGet(void);

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
	HTTP_IO_RESULT HTTPExecutePost(void)

  Summary:
	Processes POST form variables and data.

  Description:
	This function is implemented by the application developer in 
	CustomHTTPApp.c.  Its purpose is to parse the data received from
	POST forms and perform any application-specific tasks in response
	to these inputs.  Any required authentication has already been
	validated before this function is called.

	When this function is called, POST data will be waiting in the 
	TCP buffer.  curHTTP.byteCount will indicate the number of bytes
	remaining to be received before the browser request is complete.

	Since data is still in the TCP buffer, the application must call
	TCPGet or TCPGetArray in order to retrieve bytes.  When this is done,
	curHTTP.byteCount MUST be updated to reflect how many bytes now
	remain.  The functions TCPFind, TCPFindString, TCPFindROMString,
	TCPFindArray, and TCPFindROMArray may be helpful to locate data
	in the TCP buffer.

	In general, data submitted from web forms via POST is URL encoded.
	The HTTPURLDecode function can be used to decode this information
	back to a standard string if required.  If data buffer space  
	associated with this connection is required, curHTTP.data may be 
	overwritten here once the application is done with the values.  
	Any data placed there will be available to future callbacks for 
	this connection,  including HTTPExecutePost and any 
	HTTPPrint_varname dynamic substitutions.

	Whenever a POST form is processed it is recommended to issue a 
	redirect back to the browser, either to a status page or to
	the same form page that was posted.  This prevents accidental 
	duplicate submissions (by clicking refresh or back/forward) and 
	avoids browser warnings about "resubmitting form data".  Redirects
	may be issued to the browser by setting curHTTP.data to the
	destination file or URL, and curHTTP.httpStatus to HTTP_REDIRECT.
	
	Finally, this function may set cookies.  Set curHTTP.data to a series
	of name/value string pairs (in the same format in which parameters
	arrive) and then set curHTTP.hasArgs equal to the number of cookie
	name/value pairs.  The cookies will be transmitted to the browser, 
	and any future requests will have those values available in
	curHTTP.data.

  Precondition:
	None

  Parameters:
	None

  Return Values:
	HTTP_IO_DONE - application is done processing
	HTTP_IO_NEED_DATA - more data is needed to continue, and this
						function should be called again later
	HTTP_IO_WAITING - the application is waiting for an asynchronous
					  process to complete, and this function should
					  be called again later

  Remarks:
	This function is only called when the request method is POST, and is
	only used when HTTP_USE_POST is defined.  This method may NOT write
	to the TCP buffer.
	
	This function may service multiple HTTP requests simultaneously.  
	Exercise caution when using global or static variables inside this 
	routine.  Use curHTTP.callbackPos or curHTTP.data for storage associated 
	with individual requests.

  Summary:
	Determines if a given file name requires authentication
	
  Description:
	This function is implemented by the application developer in 
	CustomHTTPApp.c.  Its function is to determine if a file being
	requested requires authentication to view.  The user name and password,
	if supplied, will arrive later with the request headers, and will be
	processed at that time.
	
	Return values 0x80 - 0xff indicate that authentication is not required, 
	while values from 0x00 to 0x79 indicate that a user name and password 
	are required before proceeding.  While most applications will only use a 
	single value to grant access and another to require authorization, the 
	range allows multiple "realms" or sets of pages to be protected, with 
	different credential requirements for each.
	
	The return value of this function is saved as curHTTP.isAuthorized, and

	password supplied by the client are acceptable for this resource.
	
	The value of curHTTP.isAuthorized will be set to the previous return

	Return values 0x80 - 0xff indicate that the credentials were accepted, 
	while values from 0x00 to 0x79 indicate that authorization failed.  
	While most applications will only use a single value to grant access,

  Function:
	void HTTPPrint_varname(void)
	void HTTPPrint_varname(WORD wParam1)
	void HTTPPrint_varname(WORD wParam1, WORD wParam2, ...)
	
  Summary:
	Inserts dynamic content into a web page
	
  Description:
	Functions in this style are implemented by the application developer in 
	CustomHTTPApp.c.  These functions generate dynamic content to be 
	inserted into web pages and other files returned by the HTTP2 server.
	
	Functions of this type are called when a dynamic variable is located
	in a web page.  (ie, ~varname~ )  The name between the tilde '~' 
	characters is appended to the base function name.  In this example, the
	callback would be named HTTPPrint_varname.
	
	The function prototype is located in your project's HTTPPrint.h, which
	is automatically generated by the MPFS2 Utility.  The prototype will 
	have WORD parameters included for each parameter passed in the dynamic
	variable.  For example, the variable "~myArray(2,6)~" will generate the 
	prototype "void HTTPPrint_varname(WORD, WORD);".
	
	When called, this function should write its output directly to the TCP 
	socket using any combination of TCPIsPutReady, TCPPut, TCPPutArray, 
	TCPPutString, TCPPutROMArray, and TCPPutROMString.
	
	Before calling, the HTTP2 server guarantees that at least 
	HTTP_MIN_CALLBACK_FREE bytes (defaults to 16 bytes) are free in the 
	output buffer.  If the function is writing less than this amount, it
	should simply write the data to the socket and return.
	
	In situations where a function needs to write more this amount, it
	must manage its output state using curHTTP.callbackPos.  This value
	will be set to zero before the function is called.  If the function is
	managing its output state, it must set this to a non-zero value before
	returning.  Typically this is used to track how many bytes have been
	written, or how many remain to be written.  If curHTTP.callbackPos is
	non-zero, the function will be called again when more buffer space is
	available.  Once the callback completes, set this value back to zero
	to resume normal servicing of the request.

  Precondition:
	None
	
  Parameters:
	wParam1 - first parameter passed in the dynamic variable (if any)
	wParam2 - second parameter passed in the dynamic variable (if any)
	... - additional parameters as necessary
	
  Returns:
  	None
	
  Remarks:
	This function may service multiple HTTP requests simultaneously, 
	especially when managing its output state.  Exercise caution when using 
	global or static variables inside this routine.  Use curHTTP.callbackPos
	or curHTTP.data for storage associated with individual requests.
